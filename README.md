This is the my terminal themed website, it is somewhat capable.

there is a virtual file system and a variety of commands are supported

`clear`: clears the terminal
`ls path(optional)`: lists files and directories inside current directory or provided path.
`cd path`: moves to specified directory.
`mkdir name`: creates a directory, the name can be a path that specifies the location and name.
`rm name`: deletes the specified file, the name can be a path specifying location. NOTE: recursive by default.
`touch name content(optional)`: creates a file with the specified name and include content. NOTE: escaped characters are supported.
`echo string`: prints a string to the terminal.
`vim name`: Probably not implemented yet but maybe it is, idk.
`cat path`: outputs the contents of a file.
