## üí° **Features of the Website**
- **Virtual file system:** Navigate directories, create files, or delete everything if you‚Äôd like.
- **JavaScript executables:** Treat `.js` files like executables and run them with `./`.
- **Volatile memory:** Not really a feature tbh. if you refresh everything gets deleted, the flip side is if you break it through js scripting it can be reset easily.
