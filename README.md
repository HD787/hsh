## üí° **Features of the Website**
- **Fully destructible:** This environment is meant to be broken and explored.
- **Virtual file system:** Navigate directories, create files, or delete everything if you‚Äôd like.
- **JavaScript executables:** Treat `.js` files like executables and run them with `./`.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes:**
- **Recursive delete (`rm`):** By default, directories and files are deleted recursively. No confirmation dialogs here‚Äîso be cautious.
- **Running JavaScript:** Use `node` or `bun` to execute code. Be warned‚Äîit can break things (refresh to reset)!
- **Fun chaos:** Go ahead and try `rm -rf /` or other destructive commands. You can always refresh and start over!
