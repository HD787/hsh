Below is the list of commands you can use to explore.\n\nAvailable Commands:\n\n- clear\n  Clears the terminal screen.\n\n- ls [path (optional)]\n  Lists files and directories inside the current directory or the provided path.\n\n- cd [path]\n  Moves to the specified directory.\n\n- mkdir [name]\n  Creates a directory. The name can be a path specifying the location and name.\n\n- rm [name]\n  Deletes the specified file or directory. Recursive by default.\n\n- touch [name] [content (optional)]\n  Creates a file with the specified name and optional content. Escaped characters supported.\n\n- echo [string]\n  Prints the given string to the terminal.\n\n- vim [name]\n  Probably not implemented yet, but maybe it is—who knows?\n\n- cat [path]\n  Outputs the contents of a file.\n\n- node [string]\n  Runs the provided string as JavaScript. Warning: This can break the website, which is fine—I just think you should know.\n\n- bun [string]\n  Same as node.\n\n- ./[path-to-file]\n  Executes the JavaScript file as if it were a script.\n\nFeatures:\n\n- Fully destructible: This environment is meant to be broken and explored.\n- Virtual file system: Navigate directories, create files, or delete everything if you’d like.\n- JavaScript executables: Treat .js files like executables and run them with ./\n-Volatile memory: Not really a feature tbh. if you refresh everything gets deleted, the flip side is if you break it through js scripting it can be reset easily."
